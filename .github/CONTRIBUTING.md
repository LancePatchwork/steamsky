Here are few short advices before you open new issue.

1. Please open one issue per problem/suggestion/bug/etc. It made easier to
   discuss issue.
2. Try to bring as much as possible informations about issue. It is probably
   impossible to give too much informations :) Generally, when you want add
   something to game, try describe it as detailed as possible, when you want to
   report a bug, try to give enough informations to reproduce bug by others.
3. This may sounds rude, but please, at this moment don't add any propositions
   about new features to game. This request is better explained in game main
   contribution guide (link is at end of this text).
4. Please, before you open new issue, check did someone earlier didn't created
   that same or very similar issue (by using search).
