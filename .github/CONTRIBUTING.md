Here are a few short recommendations before you open a new issue.

1. Please open one issue per problem/suggestion/bug/etc. It makes it easier to
   discuss the issue.
2. Try to provide as much as possible regarding the issue. It is probably
   impossible to give too much informations :) Generally, when you want add
   something to the game, try describe it as detailed as possible, when you want to
   report a bug, try to give enough information to help others reproduce the bug.
3. This may sound rude, but please, at this moment don't add any suggestions
   regarding new features to the game. This request is better explained in game main
   contribution guide (link is at end of this text).
4. Please, before you open new issue, check that someone earlier didn't already create
   the same or very similar issue (by using search).
