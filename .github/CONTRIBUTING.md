Here are some suggestions before you open a new issue.

1. Please open one issue per problem/suggestion/bug/etc. It makes it easier to
   discuss the issue.
2. Try to provide as much as possible information about the issue. It is probably
   impossible to give too much information :) Generally, when you want add
   something to game, try describe it as detailed as possible, when you want to
   report a bug, try to give enough information to reproduce bug by others.
3. This may sound rude, but please, at this moment don't add any propositions
   regarding new features for the game. This request is better explained in game main
   contribution guide (link is at end of this text).
4. Please, before you open a new issue, check that someone hasn't already created
   the same or a very similar issue (by using search).
