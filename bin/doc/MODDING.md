Some general information about adding/editing game elements (skills,
ships, ships modules, etc.)

## General information about modifications
To add new things (items, ships, modules, etc) to the game, you must create
a new
directory inside the game's mod directory which is *data/mods* by default.

For example, create the directory *mymod* as *data/mods/mymod*
and place your work in a file or files with the extension *dat*
patterned similarly to the structure of the shipped files there.

For example, to add a new item to game, create a file which looks like
*data/items.dat*.

Below you will find more detailed information about the
XML data structures used by the program.

You can edit the shipped files as well of course, but modification
you make there will be overwritten when you update the game.

## Items types

### General information
* Open file *game.dat* in *data* directory or even better, create a new file in
  modifications directory.
* A file providing new items must start with tag `data`. Each item type is one
  line entry with tag `itemtype`. Structure your work on what you see in
  the *data/game.dat* file.

### Changing an existing items types
* By editing the *data/game.dat* file you can change the name of an existing
  item typeÂ by changing the `value` attribute. The maximum length is 64
  characters.
* When editing your custom file: you need to remove first selected item type,
  then add new.
* Item types are referenced in the specifications of items and recipes. Don't
  forget to change any references to your type in these files as well.

### Adding new items types
* Add a new item type, by appending a new line with tag `itemtype`. Store the
  Name of your new type in the `value` attribute. The maximum length is 64
  characters.
* All Gun ammunition must have a name beginning with `Ammo`, for example:
  *Ammo150*.
* All Harpoon Gun Ammunition types must have a name beginning with `Harpoon`.
* There can be maximum 128 types of items in the game.

### Removing item types
* You can remove item types from *data/game.dat* by removing their tag.
* Alternatively, your mod may have a `remove` tag with the attributes `name`
  set to `itemtype` and `value` set to the name of type to be removed.
* After deleting item types, don't forget remove any references to it in other
  data files.

## Characters attributes

### General information
* To add/remove/change characters attributes, open the file *game.dat* in
  *data* directory or better, create a new file in modifications directory. New
  file must start with `data` tag.
* Each attribute starts with the tag `attribute`. Attribute `name` is the name of
  the selected attribute. Value between `attribute` tags is a description of
  the attribute. Example *<attribute name="Dexterity">Nimbleness of character,
  used in many crafts</attrbute>*.
* After changing/removing attribute/s, don't forget to make the proper changes in the game
  data.
* The maximum length of the name of the attribute is 64 characters and for
  the attribute's description it is 512 characters.
* There can be maximum 16 attributes declared in the game.

### Changing an existing attribute
* If editing *game.dat* file: just change the selected value of the attribute.
* If editing your own file: you need to remove first selected attribute then add new.
* To edit the attribute name, just edit value of the attribute `name`.
* To change the attribute's description, just edit the text between `attribute` tags.

### Adding a new attribute
8 To add a new attribute, just append a new line with tag `attribute` with
  its name as attribute `name` and description between tags `attribute`. Same
  for *game.dat* file and your own file.

### Removing an existing attribute
8 In *game.dat* file: Just delete the selected attribute entry.
8 In own file: Append new line with tag `remove` which have attribute's `name`
  set to `attribute` and value with name of attribute which will be removed.

## Skills

## Debugging
If you want to test your changes, you may run game in debug mode. In this mode
game create file *debug.log* in *data* directory. To start game in debug mode
run it with parameter --debug=[debugtype]. Example:

`./steamsky --debug=everything`

At this moment available are three types of debug:

* Option 'everything' means to log each debug message to a file. At this moment
  this means information about loading game data (ships/recipes/items/modules)
  and also some combat data. This option may be useful to check that the data
  of new/added items, etc is correct. Additionally, its spawns debug menu for
  modifying the game data.
* Option 'combat' means to log debug messages only from combat.
* Option 'menu' spawns only debug menu after starting the game for modifying the
  data.
