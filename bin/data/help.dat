[General Informations]
SteamSky is roguelike game where you command small flying ship with crew. You must take care about ship and crew. You can trade items between sky bases, fight with enemies or manufacturing items. Game ends when your character die.
Whole game interface is keyboard based. Most options/menus are accessible by keyboard shortcuts. All shortcuts are case insensitive, for example, to access help, you can use 'h' or 'shift+h' key. That same is with arrows keys - you can use normal arrows and keypad arrows (after enabling Num Lock at your keyboard).
Most texts in game, can be scrolled with arrow keys by one line, by one screen with PageUp/PageDown keys or to begining by Home key and end to End key.
On mosts screens you can see in top right corner informations about needed crew positions in ship. P means pilot, E - engineer, G - gunner, R - repairs, M - manufacturing. If you have someone on this position, letters will be green, if you don't have and you need any, letters will be red, when you don't have anyone on that position and you don't need anyone there, letter will be in default text color.
At this moment, help is under heavy development (as whole game).
[Ship movement]
Your ship starts docked to base. To move it, you must first give order "Undock" from base. Press 'o' key (or first 'e' key for see game menu) for open orders menu.
When you undocked from base, in this same menu, you can set ship speed or dock again. Faster speed means you travel faster but you use more fuel too.
To move your ship, you must set it speed, have fuel (called Charcollum, which works as moneys too), and someone from ship crew assigned to pilot and engineer role. To assign crew members to selected role, open crew menu - key 'c', select desired crew member and give order by press key 'o'.
Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on this positions) and selected ship speed. 
To move ship in desired direction, use arrow keys (or better) keys on keypad (with enabled Num Lock at your keyboard).
During travel you may encounter various events (at this moment you can be only attacked by hostile ships).
Ship speed depends on engine power, engine damage, ship weight (with cargo) and bit on Engineer and Pilot experience.
As you fly near bases (you are in this same cell where base is), you discover they types and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are in default text color. 
You can wait a moment without doing anything, by hit key 5 on keypad.
To move map without moving ship, hold SHIFT and use keypad keys this same which are used for moving ship. Hit SPACE to center map on ship.
[Trading]
To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type.
Prices in bases depends on skill Bartering - with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. 
To buy/sell items from bases, open orders menu (key 'o') and then select option Trade (key 't'), you will see trading screen. Use arrows keys to select desired material to buy/sell, then press 'Enter' key to buy or 'Space' key to start trading selected item. Next, enter amount of items which you want to buy or sell and press 'Enter'. To buy/sell items you must have enough free cargo space on your ship ("moneys" aka Charcollum needs free cargo space too).
[Combat]
In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each orders then hit space for made one combat turn. Each combat turn take 1 minute of game time. 
If you give order to aim for selected part of enemy ship, your Gunner will be shoot as often as for precise fire, just chance on hit will depends on part of enemy ship. If selected enemy part will be destroyed, Gunner will be shooting in random part of enemy ship, as usual.
To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends how far and fast enemy was) you should escape.
Slow speed in combat helps your gunner hits enemies but also helps enemies hits you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with pilot orders - evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too and you die.
If your turret with gun will be destroyed, gun in this turret will be destroyed too and your gunner will be killed. When your cockpit will be destroyed, it kills pilot too.
If you don't have anyone assigned as a pilot, it is consider as a "go closer" order.
When you don't have anyone assigned as a engineer, ship will stop (same as "full stop order").
You (or enemy) starts hitting other parts of ship after destroying armor.
Sign "plus" after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member know something about selected role (have suitable skill).
Double sign "plus" after crew name in combat orders menu means that this member have highest skill needed for selected role.
Gunnery skill affects chance to hit with gun in combat and Pilot skill affect chance to evade enemy attacks.
Amount of loot from enemies depends on each enemy. Stronger enemies gives more amount of Charcollum.
You can see detailed ship/crew/cargo status during combat by pressing corresponding key ('c' for crew, 's' for ship, 'a' for cargo). There you can give normal orders to crew (even starts repairing during combat) or dropping cargo.
On combat screen you can see only damaged modules. Colors on your ship modules list show how much damaged module is:
- Default text color : module slightly damaged
- Green: module is damaged
- Yellow : module is heavily damaged
- Red : module is almost destroyed
- Blue : module is destroyed
[Crafting]
To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material and proper module installed on ship. Then you must set proper crafting order in Craft menu and give crew member order to start crafting. What ship module and which items are needed for crafting, you can check in crafting menu (key 'r'). If you don't have items or workplace needed for crafting, they will be written in red in selected recipe information. At this moment, each manufacturing order take 15 minutes of game time. If after creating item, you don't have enough materials to craft next item, crew member going on break and crafting order is reseted.
Crafting skills determine amount of manufactured items.
[Repair ship]
To start repairing ship, you must assign crew member to repair duty. You may assign more than one crew member. Each additional member assigned made repair faster. Each damaged (or destroyed) module need specific material to repair. You can check which material is needed in ship info screen. Ship is repaired every 15 minutes. Speed of repairs depends on skills of assigned crew. You can check which skills are used in ship info screen.
Additional, you can buy repairs of ship in bases. Available options depends on size of base. In all bases you can select one module to repair or order slow repair of whole ship. In medium bases, you can order normal repair of whole ship and in large bases, fast repair. Normal and fast repairs cost more Charcollum. Base cost of repair depends on how much damaged is module and price of repair material in selected base.
Cost of repairs is much lower in shipyard type bases.
[Tips]
* You and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation.
* All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press 'h' key on sky map (no need to press 'e' first to show menu).
* Each ship hull have maximum limit of module which can be installed on it. Armors and weapons are not count to hull modules limit.
* Every member of crew getting tired when have assigned order other than On break. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest. After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work.
* If you want travel faster (for example, for escape from fight), you can drop some items from your cargo. Go to cargo information screen, select desired item and press key 'd'.
* Each crew member need proper module for work. If that module is destroyed, member cannot start selected work (for example, can't start piloting when cockpit is destroyed).
* If your resting crew member don't have assigned cabin, he/she will be resting much slower.
* Crew members can regenerate health over time but only when they are on break and have assigned cabin.
* If crew member cabin is destroyed and he/she going on break, he/she will try find empty cabin as a new own to rest.
* If you want to stop renaming modules or dropping cargo, just left field with name/amount of items to drop empty. That same works for stopping buying or selling items.
