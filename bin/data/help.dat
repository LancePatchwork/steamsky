At this moment, help is under heavy development (as whole game). Below you can find few useful tips.
* You can scroll this help window with arrow keys.
* Your ship starts docked to base. To move it, you must first undock from base. Press'o' key for open orders menu.
* To move your ship, you need to set it speed, have fuel (charcollum, which works as moneys too) and pilot and engineer on duty.
* To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type.
* As you dock to stations, you discover they types and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are white.
* You can wait a moment without doing anything, by hit key 5 on keypad.
* You and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation.
* Game ends when your character die.
* Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on this positions). Prices in bases depends on skill Bartering - with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. Crafting skill determine amount of manufactured items. Gunnery affects chance to hit with gun in combat.
* In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each orders then hit space for made one combat turn. Each combat turn take 1 minute of game time.
* To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends how far enemy was) you should escape.
* Real ship speed (at this moment only in combat) depends on engine power, ship weight (with cargo) and bit on Engineer experience.
* Slow speed in combat helps your gunner hits enemies but also helps enemies hits you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with pilot orders - evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
* Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too and you die.
* To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material and proper module installed on ship. Then you must set proper crafting order in Craft menu and give crew member order to start crafting.
* To move map without moving ship, hold SHIFT and use keypad keys this same which are used for moving ship. Hit SPACE to center map on ship.
* Every member of crew getting tired when have assigned order other than On break. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest. After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work.
* All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press 'h' key on sky map (no need to press 'e' first to show menu).
