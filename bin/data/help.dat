[General Informations]
SteamSky is roguelike game where you command flying ship with crew. You must take care about ship and crew. You can trade items between sky bases, fight with enemies or manufacturing items. Game ends when your character die.
Whole game interface is keyboard based. Most options/menus are accessible by keyboard shortcuts. All shortcuts are case insensitive, for example, to access help, you can use 'h' or 'shift+h' key. That same is with arrows keys - you can use normal arrows and keypad arrows (after enabling Num Lock at your keyboard).
You can use shortcuts on most in-game menus too (not only navigate by arrows keys).
Most texts in game, can be scrolled with arrow keys by one line, by one screen with PageUp/PageDown keys or to beginning by Home key and end to End key.
Forms (for example, renaming modules) can be navigated by arrow keys too. To quit from form without changes, just jump with arrows keys to Cancel button and hit Enter. To accept changes, navigate with arrows to Ok button and then hit Enter. If you left empty field in form and press Enter, it will be count as quit without changes. 
On mosts screens you can see in top right corner informations about needed crew positions in ship. P means pilot, E - engineer, G - gunner, R - repairs, M - manufacturing, U - upgrading ship module, T - talking in bases, C - clean ship. 
For pilot and engineer if letter is green, position is taken by crew member, red means you don't have anyone assigned to this position.
For gunners and manufacturing - green letter mean all positions are taken (all guns, all crafting modules), red letter mean you have free positions (not all guns/crafting modules are taken), white letter mean, you don't have or no need anyone assigned to this positions.
For repairs, upgrading ship modules, talking in bases and cleaning ship, green you have someone assigned to this position, red means you don't have anyone on that position but need someone, and white letter means you don't have anyone assigned to this position and you don't need anyone.
To move map without moving ship, hold SHIFT and use keypad keys this same which are used for moving ship. Hit SPACE to center map on ship. In that way, you can see informations about selected map cell (for example, bases info). Window in right up corner of screen always show info about your current map cell.
At this moment, help is under heavy development (as whole game).
[Ship movement]
Your ship starts docked to base. To move it, you must first give order "Undock" from base. Press 'o' key (or first 'e' key for see game menu) for open orders menu.
Each unvisited field on map is grey. Once you fly on this field, it color change to black.
At game start, you know only one base. You can discover others by flying on it or by asking for other bases in current base. To ask, press 'o' key and then select option 'Ask for bases'. You can ask for other bases only once in each base. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered bases depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases).
When you undocked from base, in this same menu, you can set ship speed or dock again. Faster speed means you travel faster but you use more fuel too.
You can gain or lost reputation with each base. Generally, you gain reputation when you interact with base (trade, repair ship, recruit new crew members, ask for events, etc). You can check your reputation level in your list of known bases. If your reputation with base is low, you can't dock to that base.
Reputation levels, starting from lowest: Hated, Outlaw, Hostile, Unfriendly, Unknown, Visitor, Trader, Friend, Well Known.
To move your ship, you must set it speed, have fuel (called Charcollum, which works as moneys too), and someone from ship crew assigned to pilot and engineer role. To assign crew members to selected role, open crew menu - key 'c', select desired crew member and give order by press key 'o'.
Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on this positions) and selected ship speed. 
Fuel cost of travel depends on selected speed (faster = more fuel usage) and each engine fuel usage installed on ship. You can check fuel usage for each engine on ship information screen.
To move ship in desired direction, use arrow keys (or better) keys on keypad (with enabled Num Lock at your keyboard).
During travel you may encounter various events. Some events may bring new options to orders (for example, attack on other ships) or take options away (for example, full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events exists by some time. Events on map are marked with white '?'. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base once on 7 game days. To ask, press 'o' key and then select option 'Ask for events'. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases).
Ship speed depends on engine power, engine damage, ship weight (with cargo) and bit on Engineer and Pilot experience.
As you fly near bases (you are in this same cell where base is), you discover they types and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are in default text color. All bases marked on map as 'o'.
You can set your destination travel point on map by selecting map cell (with SHIFT + arrow keys) and then press Enter.
If you have set travel destination, press key 5 on keypad to auto travel. If destination is not set, pressing key 5 on keypad allow you to wait 1 game minute without moving.
[Trading]
To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base and having assigned crew member to trading with bases. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type.
Prices in bases depends on skill Rhetoric of assigned to trade crew member - with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. Additionally, prices depends on your reputation in base. With high reputation you earn more or pay less for goods, new recruits or services. 
Prices showed on trade screen are base prices, without bonuses or penalties from reputation and trader skill.
To buy/sell items from bases, open orders menu (key 'o') and then select option Trade, you will see trading screen. Use arrows keys to select desired material to buy/sell, then press 'Enter' key to buy or 'Space' key to start trading selected item. Next, enter amount of items which you want to buy or sell and select button [Ok]. To buy/sell items you must have enough free cargo space on your ship ("moneys" aka Charcollum needs free cargo space too).
[Combat]
To start combat, you must first be in this same map cell where desired target is. Then, from orders menu, select option Attack (key 'a'). 
Combat can start automatically if enemy ship spots your ship first and is faster than you. Your chance to see enemy first depends on your ship pilot and gunners Perception skill and size of ships. If you have smaller ship than enemy, it is bigger chance that you spot them first.
In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each orders then hit space for made one combat turn. Each combat turn take 1 minute of game time. 
If you give order to aim for selected part of enemy ship, your Gunners will be shoot as often as for precise fire, just chance on hit will depends on part of enemy ship. If selected enemy part will be destroyed, Gunners will be shooting in random part of enemy ship, as usual.
To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends how far and fast enemy was) you should escape.
Slow speed in combat helps your Gunners hits enemies but also helps enemies hits you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with Pilot orders - evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too and you die.
If any ship module in your ship will be destroyed, it kill crew member which is in this module too. Destroyed turret destroys mounted gun too and kill gunner which operate it, destroyed cockpit kills pilot, cabin kills resting inside crew member and workshops worker.
If you don't have anyone assigned as a Pilot, it is consider as a "go closer" order.
When you don't have anyone assigned as a Engineer, you can't change ship speed.
You (or enemy) starts hitting other parts of ship after destroying armor.
Sign "plus" after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member know something about selected role (have suitable skill).
Double sign "plus" after crew name in combat orders menu means that this member have highest skill needed for selected role.
Sign "minus" after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member have assigned position (as a gunner, pilot, etc.).
Gunnery skill affects chance to hit with gun in combat and Pilot skill affect chance to evade enemy attacks.
Amount of loot from enemies depends on each enemy. Stronger enemies gives more amount of Charcollum.
You can see detailed ship/crew/cargo/messages status during combat by pressing corresponding key ('c' for crew, 's' for ship, 'a' for cargo, 'm' for messages). There you can give normal orders to crew (even starts repairing during combat) or dropping cargo.
Battering ram don't need operator to attack, it attack automatically when enemy is in close range and it always attack only one per combat round. You can't set hit location for battering ram too.
Damage from weapon depends on level of damage itself and used ammo damage. If weapon is more damaged, it do less damage. It works for player ship and enemy ship weapons.
You can assign (during combat or outside combat) which ammunition to use with selected gun in ship info screen. If you don't assign ammo to gun, gunner will be using first available ammo from cargo which works with selected gun.
On combat screen you can see only damaged modules. Colors on your ship modules list show how much damaged module is:
- White : module slightly damaged
- Green: module is damaged
- Yellow : module is heavily damaged
- Red : module is almost destroyed
- Blue : module is destroyed
[Crafting]
To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material and proper module installed on ship. Then you must set proper crafting order in Craft menu and give crew member order to start crafting. What ship module and which items are needed for crafting, you can check in crafting menu (key 'r'). If you don't have items or workplace needed for crafting, they will be written in red in selected recipe information. Each recipe have own crafting time after which item is created, but crafter gains experience in crafting skill each 15 minutes. If after creating item, you don't have enough materials to craft next item, crew member going on break and crafting order is reseted.
Crafting skills and level of damage of workplace determine amount of manufactured items. More damaged modules causes less crafted items.
Each crafting module have separated crafting order. This mean, you can produce few types of items in this same time, if you have few crafting modules installed on ship and all have assigned work orders and workers.
[Repair/Upgrade ship]
To start repairing ship, you must assign crew member to repair duty. If you don't have available 'Repair' order, it means, you don't have materials needed for repair module. You may assign more than one crew member. Each additional member assigned made repair faster. Each damaged (or destroyed) module need specific material to repair. You can check which material is needed in ship info screen. Ship is repaired every 15 minutes of work of assigned crew members. Speed of repairs depends on skills of assigned crew. You can check which skills are used in ship info screen.
Additional, you can buy repairs of ship in bases. Available options depends on size of base. In all bases you can select one module to repair or order slow repair of whole ship. In medium bases, you can order normal repair of whole ship and in large bases, fast repair. Normal and fast repairs cost more Charcollum. Base cost of repair depends on how much damaged is module and price of repair material in selected base.
Cost of repairs is much lower in shipyard type bases.
To start upgrading ship modules you must first set which module you want to upgrade. You can do this in ship info screen. Each module may have upgraded durability and some modules have additional options to upgrade (for example, guns have option to upgrade damage). If there no options to upgrade selected module, you may reached maximum allowed upgrade level for this module. To upgrading you need materials too (it is that same material which is needed for repair module) and set crew member order to upgrade module. At this point it start slowly upgrading selected ship module. Each upgrade take some time and materials.
Speed of module upgrade depends on skill of assigned crew member (it is this same skill which is used to repair module). 
You can always change which module and what is upgrading on it. If you change module to upgrade, all your progress is saved and can be continued later. If you change only what to upgrade (for example, from damage to durability) you will lose all previous upgrade progress.
You can always stop current module upgrade. It don't cause any loses to upgrade progress, you can resume upgrade at any time.
Each upgraded module gains some weight. Amount of gain depends on base module weight and upgrade type.
In shipyard bases you can install new modules or remove old from ship. Each installation/removing take some time. Installation cost Charcollum, removing modules gives you Charcollum. There is some limitations to installation/removing modules: you can only replace ship hull module, you can have only one armor, cockpit, battering ram module installed on your ship. If you want replace armor, cockpit or battering ram, first you must remove old module from ship. 
How much you get Charcollum from removing module depends on damage of selected module. If is it destroyed, removing will take only time and give no Charcollum.
Each ship hull have maximum module space, which limit what and how much modules can be installed on it. Armor and weapons don't count to this limit. Most of basic modules use only one module space, but this most expensive modules, may use a lot of space. You can check how much each module space use on ship info screen or in shipyard screen.
[Ship crew]
You and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation.
Every member of crew getting tired when have assigned order other than On break or Talking in bases. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest. After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work.
Crew members can regenerate health over time but only when they are on break and have assigned cabin. Additionally, if you have any medical room installed on ship and medical supplies in cargo, you can assign other crew member to heal wounded. It can greatly speed up recovering (speed of healing depends on Medicine skill of healer). Only fully healed members can be healer.
If crew member cabin is destroyed (or don't have any) and he/she going on break, he/she will try find empty cabin as a new own to rest.
Speed of rest of crew members depends on quality, damage level and cleanliness of cabin which they owned. Without cabin, they rest very slow.
You can hire new crew members in bases. First you must dock to base, then you choice Recruit option from orders menu. Amount of available recruits depends on size of base. They hire cost depends on amount of knowledge (skills and level of skills). Here no limit how much crew members you can have on ship, just remember, all of them needs food, drinks and place to rest. Hiring new crew members reduce population of base. New recruits are available every 30 days between visits of base. 
If your ship is docked to base, you can dismiss crew members. Go to crew info screen and use Dismiss option on selected crew member. Dismissed crew members joins to base population.
Hunger, thirst and wounds have impact on your crew members skills. Wounded or hungry crew members have penalties to their skills.
Crew members skills levels, starting from lowest: Beginner, Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Competent, Respected, Renowned, Master, Grand-Master, Legendary, Ultimate.
[List of known bases]
In this screen you can see all bases which you know to exists. As normal menus, you can navigate list by up/down arrows. Additional, Page Up scrolls one screen up, Page Down scrolls one screen down, Home scrolls to beginning and End scrolls to end list. 
You can search for base by it name, simply start typing desired name and list will be scrolled to first exact match. In that moment, on the right, below base information, you can see searched text. You can delete last letter with Backspace key or delete whole searched text by Delete key or just selecting other base from list.
You can change what type of bases are listed with right arrow key and status of bases (any, visited, not visited) with left arrow key.
[Tips]
* All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press 'h' key on sky map (no need to press 'e' first to show menu).
* If you want travel faster (for example, for escape from fight), you can drop some items from your cargo. Go to cargo information screen, select desired item and press key 'd'.
* Each crew member need proper module for work. If that module is destroyed, member cannot start selected work (for example, can't start piloting when cockpit is destroyed).
* You can assign crew members to selected module (cabins, guns, workplaces) on ship info screen. All workplaces first must have set crafting order, before you can assign someone.
* You can reduce how long disease affect selected base by delivering medical supplies to it. If you choice deliver supplies for free, you can gain some reputation otherwise, you gain Charcollum and may lose some reputation.
* What enemy you meet depends on how much upgraded ship you have - especially on upgrades of hull, armor, weapons and type of ammo. At begining of game you can meet weakest enemies, with every ship upgrade you meet stronger. Of course, there is always small chance that you encounter enemy stronger than you.
* Which orders are available for crew members, depends on orders prerequisites. For example, if you don't have set any crafting order set, you can't assign crew member to manufacturing.
* Ship gets dirty with start every day. You can send as much as you want crew members to clean ship. It is only order which don't give any experience to assigned crew members.
