 <entry title="General Informations">{u}Overview{/u}
    Steam Sky is a roguelike game where you are commandeer of a flying ship. You must take care of ship and crew. You can trade items between sky bases, fight with enemies or manufacture items. The game ends when your character dies. At this moment, help is under development (as whole game). To see other help topics, click on topic title (for example {b}&quot;General Informations&quot;{/b} for this screen) above help text.

{u}Ship info{/u}
   On most screens you can see information about needed crew positions in the top right corner. {b}P{/b} means pilot, {b}E{/b} - engineer, {b}G{/b} - gunner, {b}R{/b} - repairs, {b}M{/b} - manufacturing, {b}U{/b} - upgrading ship module, {b}T{/b} - trader, {b}C{/b} - clean ship. 
For pilots and engineers: if their letter is green, the position is taken by a crew member, and if it's red you don't have anyone assigned to this position.
For gunners and manufacturing: a green letter mean all positions are taken (all guns, all crafting modules), a red letter means you have free positions (not all guns/crafting modules are taken), and a white letter means you don't have or don't need anyone assigned to this positions.
For repairs, upgrading ship modules, trader and cleaning ship, green means you have someone assigned to this position, red means you don't have anyone on that position but need someone, and white letter means you don't have anyone assigned to this position and you don't need anyone.</entry>
 <entry title="Ship movement">{u}Undocking from bases{/u}
    Your ship starts docked to base. To move it, you must first give order {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} from base, by clicking on {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} button. To see other orders available for ship, press {GameKey 14} key (or first {GameKey 26} key for see game menu) for open orders menu.
Each docking operation cost some money, depending on your ship size (bigger ships have bigger docking cost) and your reputation in that base. Same is with staying longer in base - for each day you pay this same price as for docking. Undocking from bases is free.
When you undocked from base, in this same menu, you can dock again. 

{u}Discovering new bases{/u}
   At game start, you know only one base. You can discover others by flying on it or by asking for other bases in current base. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for bases'{/b}. You can ask for other bases only once in each base. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered bases depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship, which you can ask for bases too.
As you fly near bases (you are in this same cell where base is), you discover they types and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are in default text color. All bases marked on map as {b}'o'{/b}.

{u}Reputation in bases{/u}
   You can gain or lost reputation with each base. Generally, you gain reputation when you interact with base (trade, repair ship, recruit new crew members, ask for events, etc.). You can check your reputation level in your list of known bases. If your reputation with base is low, you can't dock to that base. You gain (or lose) reputation twice times faster in your home base ship. You may check which base is your home base in ship info screen (press key {GameKey 11}). You may change your home base anytime you are docked to base - it base cost is 1000 {MoneyName}.
Reputation levels, starting from lowest: Hated, Outlaw, Hostile, Unfriendly, Unknown, Visitor, Trader, Friend, Well Known.

{u}Traveling{/u}
   To move your ship, you must set it speed, have fuel (called {FuelName}, which works as money too), and someone from ship crew assigned to pilot and engineer role. To assign crew members to selected role, open crew menu - press key {GameKey 13}, select desired crew member and give order.
Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on this positions) and selected ship speed. 
Fuel cost of travel depends on selected speed (faster = more fuel usage) and each engine fuel usage installed on ship. You can check fuel usage for each engine on ship information screen.
To move ship in desired direction, use (by default setting) keys on keypad. You may change which keys move ship in game options.
Ship speed depends on engine power, engine damage, ship weight (with cargo) and bit on Engineer and Pilot experience.
With higher set ship speed, there is bigger chance that one of engines will be damaged. More experienced Engineer have better chances to prevent engine damage during fly.

{u}Events{/u}
   During travel you may encounter various events. Some events may bring new options to orders (for example, attack on other ships) or take options away (for example, full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events exists by some time. Events on map are marked with mark {b}'?'{/b}. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base once on 7 game days. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for events'{/b}. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time, you can meet friendly ship which you can ask for events too.

{u}Setting ship destination{/u}
   You can set your destination travel point on map by selecting map cell by left click on it. If you left click on map cell where your ship is, you will open orders menu.
If you have set travel destination, press key {GameKey 5} to auto travel by one map field. If you want move further, you can press {GameKey 10} key - then you been move until you reach destination, combat happen or you can't move anymore (no pilot/engineer, too damaged engines, no fuel, etc.).
If destination is not set, pressing key {GameKey 5} allow you to wait 1 game minute without moving.</entry>
 <entry title="Trading">To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base and having assigned crew member to talking in bases. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type.
Prices in bases depends on skill {TalkingSkill} of assigned to trade crew member - with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. Additionally, prices depends on your reputation in base. With high reputation you earn more or pay less for goods, new recruits or services. 
From time to time, base prices of items can change a little (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base and it is higher when you visit that base less often.
Prices showed on trade screen are base prices, without bonuses or penalties from reputation and trader skill.
To buy/sell items from bases, open orders menu (key {GameKey 14}) and then select option Trade, you will see trading screen. Select desired material to buy/sell, then select did you want sell or buy them. Next, enter amount of items which you want to buy or sell and press button. If you want to sell all owned items of that type, just select button [Sell all]. To buy/sell items you must have enough free cargo space on your ship (&quot;money&quot; aka {MoneyName} needs free cargo space too).
How much base can buy items depends on how much it have money. This amount can change with time (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base and it is higher when you visit that base less often. Bigger bases have more money than small.
Same with buying items from bases - they have limited amount of items for sale. Bigger bases have more items than small. Additionally, from time to time amount of items change (going up or down). Chance for change depends on base size and raise when you visit that base less often.
From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship in space with which you can trade too. It is very similar to trade with bases, you need someone assigned to Talk in bases duty, etc.</entry>
 <entry title="Combat">To start combat, you must first be in this same map cell where desired target is. Then, from orders menu, select option Attack. 
Combat can start automatically if enemy ship spots your ship first and is faster than you. Your chance to see enemy first depends on your ship pilot and gunners {PerceptionSkill} skill and size of ships. If you have smaller ship than enemy, it is bigger chance that you spot them first.
In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each orders then hit space for made one combat turn. Each combat turn take 1 minute of game time. To set crew member to selected position, left click on proper position (like Pilot, Engineer, etc) and then left click on column with crew member name. To set order for selected position, first left click on proper position, then again left click on order column to select proper order.
If you give order to aim for selected part of enemy ship, your Gunners will be shoot as often as for precise fire, just chance on hit will depends on part of enemy ship. If selected enemy part will be destroyed, Gunners will be shooting in random part of enemy ship, as usual.
Order 'Aim for weapon' hits directly battering rams or turrets for guns.
To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends how far and fast enemy was) you should escape.
Slow speed in combat helps your Gunners hits enemies but also helps enemies hits you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with Pilot orders - evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too and you die.
If any ship module in your ship will be destroyed, it kill crew member which is in this module too. Destroyed turret destroys mounted gun too and kill gunner which operate it, destroyed cockpit kills pilot, cabin kills resting inside crew member and workshops worker.
If you don't have anyone assigned as a Pilot, it is consider as a &quot;go closer&quot; order.
When you don't have anyone assigned as a Engineer, you can't change ship speed.
You (or enemy) starts hitting other parts of ship after destroying armor.
Sign &quot;plus&quot; after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member know something about selected role (have suitable skill).
Double sign &quot;plus&quot; after crew name in combat orders menu means that this member have highest skill needed for selected role.
Sign &quot;minus&quot; after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member have assigned position (as a gunner, pilot, etc.).
{GunnerySkill} skill affects chance to hit with gun or harpoon gun in combat and {PilotingSkill} skill affect chance to evade enemy attacks.
Amount of loot from enemies depends on each enemy. Stronger enemies gives more amount of {MoneyName}.
You can see detailed ship/crew/cargo/messages status during combat by pressing corresponding button. There you can give normal orders to crew (even starts repairing during combat) or dropping cargo.
Battering ram don't need operator to attack, it attack automatically when enemy is in close range and it always attack only one per combat round. You can't set hit location for battering ram too.
Harpoon gun does only minimal damage, it's main role is stop enemy ship. It works only on ships without armor (this which don't have any or have destroyed armor first) and it attack range is smaller than normal gun. How long enemy ship will be stopped depends on harpoon gun, harpoon used as ammunition and size of enemy ship. Setting hit location for harpoon gun only change chance to hit.
When enemy ship (or your) is stopped by harpoon, you can set boarding party to attack enemy ship crew directly. To do it, press 'Board enemy ship' button to open boarding party menu. Then select which crew members you want to send to enemy ship. They start attacking enemy crew in next combat turn. If you want to remove crew member from boarding party, assign him (or her) to any combat position or send on break in crew info window. If enemy ship (or your) will escape during combat, all your boarding party members will be dead. Chance for hit during melee combat depends on attacker weapon skill (or unarmed skill, if not using weapon) and defender {DodgeSkill} skill (which can be reduced by worn armor). Damage depends on attacker weapon and his/her strength, defender armor and damage type of weapon (impaling damage is best against unarmored targets, cutting is good for all and blunt is best against heavy armored targets). If you assign self to boarding party, you will be able to give orders them during boarding (instead of giving orders to crew on ship). In that situation you can assign targets for boarding crew members or send them back to ship. If you want to back to give orders for ship, you must give self order &quot;Return to ship&quot;.
When you destroy enemy ship with using of boarding party, you will get better loot from that ship.
Damage from weapon depends on level of damage itself and used ammo damage. If weapon is more damaged, it do less damage. It works for player ship and enemy ship weapons.
You can assign (during combat or outside combat) which ammunition to use with selected gun in ship info screen. If you don't assign ammo to gun, gunner will be using first available ammo from cargo which works with selected gun.
On combat screen you can see only damaged modules. Progress bar show how much damaged is selected module (more damage = bigger progress).
Amount of informations about enemy ship depends on distance to it. In close range, you can see detailed informations about enemy ship modules. In any bigger range, only very general informations.
After destroying enemy ship, you have small chance to lose some reputation with home sky base of enemy ship.</entry>
 <entry title="Crafting">To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material, proper module installed on ship and proper tool in ship cargo or in designed crew member inventory. Then you must set proper crafting order in Craft menu and give crew member order to start crafting. What ship module and which items are needed for crafting, you can check in crafting menu (key {GameKey 15}). If you don't have items or workplace needed for crafting, they will be written in red in selected recipe information. Each recipe have own crafting time after which item is created, but crafter gains experience in crafting skill each 15 minutes. If after creating item, you don't have enough materials or tools to craft next item, crew member going on break and crafting order is cleared.
For crafting items you can set how many times you want to craft it. For deconstructing items, you may choice only workshop.
Crafter always use tool which he/she have currently equipped. If he/she don't have any equipped, he/she take it from own inventory or from ship cargo. You may set manually which tool to use by equipping it in crew member inventory screen.
Each tool have chance to be damaged during crafting. Chance on damage tool depends on tool and crafting skill.
Crafting skills and level of damage of workplace determine amount of manufactured items. More damaged modules causes less crafted items.
Each crafting module have separated crafting order. This mean, you can produce few types of items (or few times this same item) in this same time, if you have few crafting modules installed on ship and all have assigned work orders and workers.
At beginning of game, you know only few basic crafting recipes. To discover more, you must deconstruct item which crafting recipe you want to reveal. Deconstructing works in similar way like normal crafting order - with two differences: deconstructing take always one item to finish and it is always executed in alchemy lab module. List of available deconstruction orders depends on items which you have in ship cargo.
Additionally, you can buy crafting recipes in bases. Which recipes are available, depends on base type and known recipes. If you don't have option &quot;Buy recipes&quot; in orders menu when docked to base, this mean you bought or know all available recipes in that base type.</entry>
 <entry title="Repair/Upgrade ship">To start repairing ship, you must assign crew member to repair duty. If you don't have available 'Repair' order, it means, you don't have materials needed for repair module. You may assign more than one crew member or give order to repair for whole crew. Each additional member assigned made repair faster. Each damaged (or destroyed) module need specific material to repair and repair tools for each member assigned to repair duty. You can check which material is needed in ship info screen. Ship is repaired every 15 minutes of work of assigned crew members. Speed of repairs depends on skills of assigned crew. You can check which skills are used in ship info screen.
Additional, you can buy repairs of ship in bases. Available options depends on size of base. In all bases you can select one module to repair or order slow repair of whole ship. In medium bases, you can order normal repair of whole ship and in large bases, fast repair. Normal and fast repairs cost more {MoneyName}. Base cost of repair depends on how much damaged is module and price of repair material in selected base.
Cost of repairs is much lower in shipyard type bases.
To start upgrading ship modules you must first set which module you want to upgrade. You can do this in ship info screen. Each module may have upgraded durability and some modules have additional options to upgrade (for example, guns have option to upgrade damage). If there no options to upgrade selected module, you may reached maximum allowed upgrade level for this module. To upgrading you need materials (it is that same material which is needed for repair module), repair tools in your ship cargo (or designed crew member inventory) and set crew member order to upgrade module. At this point it start slowly upgrading selected ship module. Each upgrade take some time and materials.
Speed of module upgrade depends on skill of assigned crew member (it is this same skill which is used to repair module). 
You can always change which module and what is upgrading on it. If you change module to upgrade, all your progress is saved and can be continued later. If you change only what to upgrade (for example, from damage to durability) you will lose all previous upgrade progress.
You can always stop current module upgrade. It don't cause any loses to upgrade progress, you can resume upgrade at any time.
Each upgraded module gains some weight. Amount of gain depends on base module weight, its durability and upgrade type.
In shipyard bases you can install new modules or remove old from ship. Each installation/removing take some time. Installation cost {MoenyName}, removing modules gives you {MoneyName}. There is some limitations to installation/removing modules: you can only replace ship hull module, you can have only one armor, cockpit, battering ram module installed on your ship. If you want replace armor, cockpit or battering ram, first you must remove old module from ship. 
How much you get {MoneyName} from removing module depends on damage of selected module. If is it destroyed, removing will take only time and give no {MoneyName}.
Each ship hull have maximum module space, which limit what and how much modules can be installed on it. Armor and weapons don't count to this limit. Most of basic modules use only one module space, but this most expensive modules, may use a lot of space. You can check how much each module space use on ship info screen or in shipyard screen.</entry>
 <entry title="Ship crew">You and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation. Amount of reduced hunger/thirst depends on consumables - more expensive consumables can restore more. If you don't have any food rations in ship cargo, hungry crew members can eat raw food (like fresh vegetables) too, just that type of food reduce hunger for a lot less.
Every crew member have morale. When he/she resting, he/she slowly gaining it (only when morale level is low), every time when he/she back to work, he/she losing a bit morale. Same with giving orders: giving new orders except resting, reduce morale a little. If member morale is very low, he/she may refuse to obey orders. Low morale reduces crew member loyalty too. If crew member loyalty will be low he/she stop obey orders and may left your crew anytime you dock to base. In other way, high morale raises crew member loyalty.
Each crew member must be paid. It may be daily payment - constant value of {MoneyName} paid on new day or percent of profit from selling items in bases or to traders. If you don't have enough {MoneyName} to pay, unpaid crew member will lose morale.
When your crew member die, you will stay with his/her body in your ship cargo. At this moment, you can only drop that body from cargo. Additionally, all other crew members lose some morale.
Every member of crew getting tired when have assigned order other than On break or Talking in bases. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest. After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work.
To assign selected crew member to position, select it from list by left click and then left click again on member order to select other.
Crew members can regenerate health over time but only when they are on break and have assigned cabin. Additionally, if you have medical supplies in cargo, you can assign other crew member to heal wounded. It can greatly speed up recovering (speed of healing depends on {HealingSkill} skill of healer). Having installed medical room on ship speed up healing too. Only fully healed members can be healer. If you don't have {HealingTools} on ship, you can heal wounded crew members in bases. Cost of healing depends mostly on price of {HealingTools} in selected base.
If crew member cabin is destroyed (or don't have any) and he/she going on break, he/she will try find empty cabin as a new own to rest.
Speed of rest of crew members depends on quality, damage level and cleanliness of cabin which they owned. Without cabin, they rest very slow.
If your ship is docked to base, you can dismiss crew members. Go to crew info screen and use Dismiss option from Orders menu on selected crew member. Dismissed crew members joins to base population. Dismissing crew member little reduces morale of rest of crew.
Hunger, thirst, wounds and low morale have impact on your crew members skills. Wounded or hungry crew members have penalties to their skills.
When crew member start working on duty which needs any tool (like crafting, cleaning, upgrading or repairing ship) he/she takes needed tool to own inventory and equipping it if he/she don't have proper tool equipped. You can manually set which tool he/she should use in inventory screen.
Each crew member have maximum encumbrance for inventory which depends on his/her {StrengthName}.
Crew members skills levels, starting from lowest: Beginner, Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Competent, Respected, Renowned, Master, Grand-Master, Legendary, Ultimate.
Crew members attributes levels, starting from lowest: Very low, Low, Below average, Average, Above average, High, Very high, Outstanding.
Each skill is associated with one attribute. It means that real skill level is sum of skill level and associated attribute level. Gaining experience in skill cause gaining experience in associated attribute too. Attributes levels grows much slower than skills levels. Additionally, if you gain experience in any skill, you gain experience in {ConditionName} too.
You may train selected crew member in any skill in bases. Each training session takes 60 minutes and gives some experience in trained skill and associated attribute. Cost of training depends on skill level. Gained experience depends on associated attribute. Additionally, if you have installed any training room module on your ship, you can train skills there. First, you must set which skill you want to train in this training room in Ship Info screen. Then give selected crew member order to train.
Each crew member can have set orders priorities. Highest priority means that this crew member will be stop current work and go on selected order if that position is needed and vacant. Normal priority means that this crew member will take selected position when he/she is on break if that position is needed and vacant. None means that this crew member will be ignore selected position if that position is needed and vacant.
To set orders priorities, click button 'Set orders priorities' and select priority, then left click on priority level to change it. When you finish setting, press 'Accept changes' button.
If contract of crew member will ends, he/she will be treated like passenger (you can't give orders to that crew member anymore) and will leave your ship in next not abandoned base to which you dock. Until this, you must still feed him/her with food and drinks.</entry>
 <entry title="Missions">You can ask for missions in bases where you have reputation level Unknown or above. Each base offers different missions - they amount depends on base size (in bigger bases you can get more missions) and on player reputation in that base (better reputation, more missions available). To see what missions are available in selected base, first you must dock to it then select option Missions from Orders menu (key {GameKey 14}). How many missions you can accept in base, depends on your reputation - with higher level, you can get more missions.
Red color of cabin name in Transport passengers missions in Available Missions menu means you don't have installed that cabin on ship. Yellow means you have that type cabin but it is taken by someone else.
Each mission have time limit - if you don't finish mission in that time, mission will fail. Delivery mission will fail too if you drop mission item from your cargo. Transport passengers mission will fail if you dismiss passenger from your ship. If you fail mission, you lose some reputation with that base.
You can see all accepted missions in Missions menu (key {GameKey 19}). There you can set mission target map cell as destination for your ship.
To finish mission, you must fly to map cell where mission target is and from Orders menu (key {GameKey 14}) select proper order (for example, for patrol missions, you must select order 'Patrol area'). After some game time mission will be finished (for delivery or transport passengers missions) or ready to finish (any other type of missions). In second case, you must back to base from which you accepted mission to receive reward for it.
Amount of {MoneyName} for a mission depends on distance which you must fly to complete mission, type of mission and amount of free space in your ship cargo. If you don't have free space in cargo ship, you don't get reward for mission.
Amount of reputation gained for finished mission or lost for failed mission depends on (same as amount of money) distance you must fly to complete mission and type of mission.
If you successfully finish mission, your character gain some morale, if you fail, he/she will lose some morale.
Some details about different types of missions:
- Deliver items: you don't need to dock to base to finish this mission, you can select proper order before docking. But you must have someone assigned to 'Talk in bases' position. Additionally, deliver missions gives reputation to both bases (base where mission was started and base where mission was ended).
- Transport passengers: generally similar to Deliver items missions - gives reputation to both bases, etc. Passengers are special crew members - you can't assign them to work, you can't change they cabin. They need food and drinks during transport. Same as normal crew members they can die during combat if they cabin will be destroyed.
- Patrol or Explore area: If you been attacked by enemy during exploring or patrolling, after fight you need to patrol or explore area again (again select proper order from Orders menu).
- Destroy ship: Same as Patrol area - if you been attacked by other ship during searching for target, first you must finish this fight before you can start search again. If you escape from fight with mission target, you been need to search for it again.</entry>
 <entry title="Hiring crew members">You can hire new crew members in bases. First you must dock to base, then you choice Recruit option from orders menu. Amount of available recruits depends on size of base. They hire cost and future payment, depends on amount of knowledge (amount of skills and attributes and levels of skills and attributes) and equipment. When you start negotiations, you can change future payments and length of contract with recruit to raise or lower hiring price. If you offer higher payments, hire cost will be lower. If you offer lower payments than recruit expected, you been need to pay him/her more for join your crew. Default price is for permanent contract with that recruit. If you choice shorter period of time, you will pay much less for hiring it. Here no limit how much crew members you can have on ship, just remember, all of them needs food, drinks, place to rest and payment. Hiring new crew members reduce population of base. New recruits are available every 30 days between visits of base. Starting morale of recruit depends on player reputation in selected base.</entry>
 <entry title="Tips">* All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press {GameKey 22} key on sky map (no need to press {GameKey 26} first to show menu).
* If you want travel faster (for example, for escape from fight), you can drop some items from your cargo. Go to cargo information screen, select desired item and select proper option from item options menu.
* Each crew member need proper module for work. If that module is destroyed, member cannot start selected work (for example, can't start piloting when cockpit is destroyed).
* You can assign crew members to selected module (cabins, guns, workplaces) on ship info screen. All workplaces first must have set crafting order, before you can assign someone.
* You can reduce how long disease affect selected base by delivering medical supplies to it. If you choice deliver supplies for free, you can gain some reputation otherwise, you gain {MoneyName} and may lose some reputation.
* What enemy you meet depends on how much upgraded ship you have - especially on upgrades of hull, armor, weapons and type of ammo. At beginning of game you can meet weakest enemies, with every ship upgrade you meet stronger. Of course, there is always small chance that you encounter enemy stronger than you.
* Each enemy can be different: very often enemy ships have some modules upgrades installed (stronger version of weapon, more durability, etc).
* Which orders are available for crew members, depends on orders prerequisites. For example, if you don't have set any crafting order set, you can't assign crew member to manufacturing.
* Your ship gets dirty at the start of every day. You can send as many crew members as you want to clean the ship or give an order to the whole crew. It is the only order which don't give any experience to assigned crew members. You need any type of bucket to execute this order.
* A base's population may change with time. Don't be surprised when a small base may be abandoned after a successful attack on it or after disease. A base's population may grow with time.
* You may set some game options during play by selecting 'Game Options' menu (key {GameKey 23}). Changes done to options are used in current and each next game.
* If you deliver {HealingTools} for free to diseased base, you gain some reputation in that base. If you sell {HealingTools} to diseased base, you earn some money but lose reputation. The amount of gained or lost reputation depends on how much {HealingTools} you gave or sold.
* You can check the progress of your character goal in 'Game statistics' menu (key {GameKey 21}). There you can change it too, but if you do it, progress of old goal will be lost. If you finish your current goal, a new random goal will be given.
