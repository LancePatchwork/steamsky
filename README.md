## General Info

Steam Sky is an open source roguelike with a steampunk setting. You are the
commander of a flying ship, as leader you will be traveling across floating
bases, engaging in combat, trading goods etc. There is no mandatory ending
to the game, you may freely play until your character dies. The game is
currently in constant development, but is in a playable state. Steam Sky is
available for Linux and Windows 64-bit platforms. If you read this file
on GitHub: **please don't send pull requests here**. All will be automatically
closed. Any code propositions should go to the [Fossil](https://www.laeran.pl.eu.org/repositories/steamsky) repository.

## Game versions

There are currently 2 versions of the game:

* 10.0.x: "stable" version of game. This version will receive bug fixes but
  no new features. Source code for this version is in the *10.0* branch.
* 10.x: "development" version of game, future version 11.0. This is where
  game feature updates happen. Due to new features, save compatibility
  will typically break between releases. Use this version at your own risk.
  Source code for this version is in the *trunk* branch. **This** version.

## Build game from sources

### Nimble way

First, you will need to install [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) programming
language. It is recommended to use instructions from the download page.
Linux packages are usually outdated and may not work.
Perhaps the easiest way to build the game is to use [nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)
tool. It will install all needed Nim packages. Additionally, you will need
to install *Tcl* and *Tk* development version of packages. On Windows, you can
use [MagicSplat](https://www.magicsplat.com/tcl-installer/index.html)
installer, on Debian-based distributions, it will be `apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev`.
Additional libraries, needed for running the game are listed in the section
**Libraries needed to run the game** of the README.md.

When you have all dependencies installed, in the main directory, where this
file is, type: `nimble release -y` for build the release version of the
game, or `nimble debug -y` to build the debug version of the game.

You can also use the script `build.nims` from `others`. In the main directory,
where this file is, type `others/build.nims` on Linux or `nim others\build.nims`
on Windows. It will build the game and put all needed files (except libraries)
to directory *release* in the project root directory (where this file is).

### Docker way

You can use Docker images `build` and `buildwin64` from the project
[Docker](https://github.com/thindil/docker). They contain all libraries

and compiler needed to build the game.

To build the game for Linux, download `build` image and type in console:

`docker run --rm -v [path to source code]:/app ghcr.io/thindil/build /bin/bash -c "cd /app && others/build.nims"`

To build the game for Windows 64-bit, download `buildwin64` image and type in console:

`docker run --rm -v [path to source code]:/app ghcr.io/thindil/buildwin64 /bin/bash -c "cd /app && others/build.nims x86_64-windows"`

It will build the game and put all needed files (except libraries) to directory
*release* in the project root directory (where this file is).

### Build unit tests

Use the script `tests.nims` from the `others` directory. In the project's main
directory (where this file is):

* From console: type `others/tests.nims 1`. The argument is how many times
  repeat the tests.

The project's tests use package [unittest2](https://github.com/status-im/nim-unittest2),
thus all its runtime options can be used to run the tests.

## Generating code documentation

To generate (or regenerate) code documentation, you can use the default *nimble*
task, `nimble doc [filename]`. It will generate the HTML code documentation
of the selected file. To build the code documenation for the whole project,
type in console: `nimble docs -y`, in the main directory, where the file is.
It will generate the code documenation in the *htmldoc* directory.

## Running Steam Sky

If you compiled the game just clicking on (or executing in console) `steamsky`
(on Linux) or `steamsky.exe` (on Windows) in `bin` directory should run it.
If you use the downloaded version, the executable file is in the main
directory.

### Libraries needed to run the game

Additionally, the game requires a few more libraries to run. They are included
in the releases:

* TkLib. Included in MagicSplat version for Windows, on Linux should
  be available in all mayor distributions.

* Tk extension *tksvg*. You can get it from:

   <https://github.com/auriocus/tksvg>

* Tk extension *extrafont*. You can get it from:

   <https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/extrafont>

### Starting parameters
You can specify the game directories through command-line parameters.
Possible options are:

* --datadir=[directory] This is where the game data files are kept.
   Example: `./steamsky --datadir=/home/user/game/tmp`.
   Default value is *data/*

* --savedir=[directory] This is where savegames and logs are kept.
   The Game must have written permission to this directory.
   Example: `./steamsky --savedir=/home/user/.saves`.
   Default value is *data/saves/*

* --docdir=[directory] This is where the game documentation is.
   Example `./steamsky --docdir=/usr/share/steamsky/doc`.
   Default value is *doc/*.

* --modsdir=[directory] This is where mods are loaded from.
   Example:`./steamsky --modsdir=/home/user/.mods`.
   Default value is *data/mods/*

* --themesdir=[directory] This is where custom themes are loaded from.
   Example: `./steamsky --themesdir=/home/user/.mods`.
   Default value is *data/themes/*

Of course, you can set all the parameters at once:
`./steamsky --datadir=somedir/ --savedir=otherdir/ --docdir=anotherdir/`

Paths to directories can be absolute or relative where file `steamsky` is. For
Windows, use `steamsky.exe` instead `./steamsky`. If you use AppImage version
of the game, you can also use all of this starting parameters.

### Testing versions

Here are available testing versions of the game. You can find them
in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/thindil/steamsky/actions/workflows/ada-devel.yml).
Just select option from the list of results to see Artifacts list.
To use them, first you must download normal release. Then unpack files
(replace existing) to the proper location where the game is installed.

* steamsky-development-windows.tar contains Windows 64-bit version of the game.

* steamsky-development-linux.tar contains Linux 64-bit version of the game.

Size is a file's size after unpacking. You will download it compressed with
Zip.

That's all for now, as usual, I have probably forgotten about something important ;)
