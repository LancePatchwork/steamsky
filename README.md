## General Info

Steam Sky is an open source roguelike with a steampunk setting. You are a
commander of a flying ship, as leader you will be traveling across floating
bases, engaging in combat, trading goods etc. There is no mandatory ending
to this game, you may freely play until your character die. The game is
currently under heavy development, but is in a playable state. Steam Sky is
available on Linux and Windows 64 bit platforms.

## Game versions
There are currently 2 versions of the game:
- 3.0.x: "stable" version of game. This version will receive bug fixes but
  no new features. Source code for this version is in *3.0* branch.
- 3.x: "development" version of game, future version 4.0. This is where
  game feature updates will happen. Due to new features, save compatibility
  will typically break between releases. Use this version at your own risk.
  Source code for this version is in the *master* branch.

## Build game from sources

To build(works on Linux and Windows too) you need:

* compiler - GCC with enabled Ada support or (best option) GNAT from:

  https://www.adacore.com/download/

  It is recommended to use GNAT GPL 2018 to compile the game on Linux.
  Game does not work with old compilers (like GCC 4.9) since it
  lacks full support for Ada 2012

* GtkAda library which should be available in most Linux distributions. Best
  option is to use (with GNAT GPL) AdaCore version of GtkAda from:

  https://www.adacore.com/download/more

  At this moment tested version of GtkAda is 2018 and game require GTK library
  in version 3.14 (may not works with other versions).

If you have all the required packages, navigate to the main directory(where
this file is) to compile:

* Easiest way to compile game is use Gnat Programming Studio included in GNAT.
  Just run GPS, select *steamsky.gpr* as a project file and select option
  `Build All`.

* If you prefer using console: in main source code directory type `gprbuild`
  for debug mode build or for release mode: `gprbuild -XMode=release`


## Running Steam Sky

### Linux
If you use downloaded binaries, you don't need any additional libraries. Just
run `./steamsky.sh` script or start the game by menu entry. Game will not
works if you try to start it by binary file `steamsky`.

### Windows
If you use downloaded binaries just clicking on `steamsky.exe` in `bin`
directory should run it or start the game by menu entry.

### Starting parameters
You can set game directories by starting parameters. Possible options are:

* --datadir=[directory] set directory where all game data files (and
  directories like ships, items, etc.) are. Example: `./steamsky.sh
  --datadir=/home/user/game/tmp`. Default value is *data/*

* --savedir=[directory] set directory where game (or logs) will be saved. Game
  must have write permission to this directory. Example: `./steamsky.sh
  --savedir=/home/user/.saves`. Default value is *data/saves/*

* --docdir=[directory] set directory where game documentation is (at this
  moment important only for license and changelog files). Example `./steamsky.sh
  --docdir=/usr/share/steamsky/doc`. Default value is *doc/*.

* --modsdir=[directory] set directory where game modifications are. Example:
  `./steamsky.sh --modsdir=/home/user/.mods`. Default value is *data/mods/*

* --themesdir=[directory] set directory where game themes are. Example:
  `./steamsky.sh --themesdir=/home/user/.mods`. Default value is *data/themes/*

Of course, you can set all parameters together: `./steamsky.sh --datadir=somedir/
--savedir=otherdir/ --docdir=anotherdir/`

Paths to directories can be absolute or relative where file `steamsky` (Linux)
or `steamsky.exe` (Windows) is. For Windows, use `steamsky.exe` instead
`./steamsky.sh`.
