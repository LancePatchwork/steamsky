## General Info

Steam Sky is an open source roguelike with a steampunk setting. You are a
commander of a flying ship, as leader you will be traveling across floating
bases, engaging in combat, trading goods etc. There is no mandatory ending
to the game, you may freely play until your character dies. The game is
currently constant development, but is in a playable state. Steam Sky is
available for Linux and Windows 64 bit platforms.

## Game versions
There are currently 2 versions of the game:
- 4.0.x: "stable" version of game. This version will receive bug fixes but
  no new features. Source code for this version is in *4.0* branch.
- 4.x: "development" version of game, future version 5.0. This is where
  game feature updates happen. Due to new features, save compatibility
  will typically break between releases. Use this version at your own risk.
  Source code for this version is in the *master* branch. **This** version.

## Build game from sources

To build(works on Linux and Windows too) you need:

* compiler - GCC with enabled Ada support or (best option) GNAT from:

  https://www.adacore.com/download/

  It is recommended to use GNAT GPL 2019 to compile the game on Linux.
  Game does not work with old compilers (like GCC 4.9) since it
  lacks full support for Ada 2012

* GtkAda library which should be available in most Linux distributions. Best
  option is to use (with GNAT GPL) AdaCore version of GtkAda from:

  https://www.adacore.com/download/more

  At this moment tested version of GtkAda is 2019 and game require GTK library
  in version 3.14 (may not works with other versions).

If you have all the required packages, navigate to the main directory(where
this file is) to compile:

* Easiest way to compile game is use Gnat Programming Studio included in GNAT.
  Just run GPS, select *steamsky.gpr* as a project file and select option
  `Build All`.

* If you prefer using console: in main source code directory type `gprbuild`
  for debug mode build or for release mode: `gprbuild -XMode=release`. You
  can also use build script `build.sh`. Command: `./build.sh debug` will build
  the game in debug mode. Command: `.build.sh release` will build the game in
  release mode and put all needed files in *usr* directory. If you want to only
  build release version of the game, use only `gprbuild -XMode=release`
  command.

### Build unit tests

In main source directory, from console: type `./build.sh tests`

### Build.sh script

This is main build script for the game. To see all available options for it,
in main source directory, type `./build.sh help`

## Generating code documentation

To generate (or regenerate) code documentation, you need [ROBODoc](https://rfsber.home.xs4all.nl/Robo/).
If you have it, in main the game directory (where this file is) enter terminal
command: `./generatedocs.py`. For more information about this script, please
look [here](https://github.com/thindil/roboada#generatedocspy). This version
of script have set all default settings for Steam Sky code. You can also use
build script `build.sh` for this. Enter command: `./build.sh docs`.

## Running Steam Sky

### Linux
If you use downloaded AppImage version, you don't need any additional
libraries. Just run it as any AppImage file. More informations about AppImage
files usage, you can find at:

https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html

When you trying to run build by yourself version of the game, use script
`run.sh`. Game will not works if you try to start it by binary file
`steamsky` from `bin` directory. This script generally was created for
testing purposes, may require some changes especially if you want to run
the game which was build in release mode. In that situation, probably
easier way will be decompress AppImage version of the game and replace
files inside with the new version.

### Windows
If you compiled the game or downloaded the binaries just clicking on
`steamsky.exe` in the `bin` directory should run it.

### Starting parameters
You can specify the game directories through command-line parameters.
Possible options are:

* --datadir=[directory] This is where the game data files are kept.
   Example: `./run.sh --datadir=/home/user/game/tmp`.
   Default value is *data/*

* --savedir=[directory] This is where savegames and logs are kept.
   The Game must have write permission to this directory.
   Example: `./run.sh --savedir=/home/user/.saves`.
   Default value is *data/saves/*

* --docdir=[directory] This is where the game documentation is.
   Example `./run.sh --docdir=/usr/share/steamsky/doc`.
   Default value is *doc/*.

* --modsdir=[directory] This is where mods are loaded from.
   Example:`./run.sh --modsdir=/home/user/.mods`.
   Default value is *data/mods/*

* --themesdir=[directory] This is where custom themes are loaded from.
   Example: `./run.sh --themesdir=/home/user/.mods`.
   Default value is *data/themes/*

Of course, you can set all parameters together:
`./run.sh --datadir=somedir/ --savedir=otherdir/ --docdir=anotherdir/`

Paths to directories can be absolute or relative where file `steamsky` is. For
Windows, use `steamsky.exe` instead `./run.sh`. If you use AppImage version
of the game, you can also use all of this starting parameters.
